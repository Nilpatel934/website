        <h1 class="heading-primary">The Legislation Process</h1>
        <p class="description u-margin-bottom-small">
            Our legislation is divided into our Constitution and a number of Acts. The Constitution houses the most
            broad definitions of our responsibilities and powers, while the Acts define specific regulation for a 
            variety of topics.
        </p>
        <p class="description u-margin-bottom-small">
            The Operations and Evaluations committee (O&E) is the primary keeper of our legislation and they are tasked
            with the responsibility of maintaining the Constitution and accompanying Acts to best reflect the needs of
            our dynamic organization. It is through their work that we are able to comply with University standards.
        </p>
        <p class="description u-margin-bottom-small">
            Once O&E makes a change and votes in support of it, the new legislation will go before Full Senate. Any legislativ
            change requires majority vote of Full Senate twice. Changing our legislation is not easy, which allows a stable
            and thoughtful process.
